# Battery holder

Designed to hold two AAA batteries and the springy metal contacts. Half-assed, because it ended up not fitting the device I needed it for, which has soldered in batteries.

It works but needs tweaking. The constant sidewall thickness was not a good idea, it's not strong enough to not be deformed by the battery springs.
