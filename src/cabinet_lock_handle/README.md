# Cabinet lock handles

These replace the lock mechanism of some common cabinet locks found on a lot of furniture (the dimensions are for the IKEA PS metal cabinet).

For that specific cabinet (and I suppose all similar ones), if you want to make handles for both sides, these need to be mirror images of each other. So you need to change the location of the "rotation stop", which can be done by changing the angle on l69.
