# thingies

This is a code-CAD repository for things that I made to fix issues around my place or someone else's.

I'm mostly keeping these here in case these things break and I need to print new ones later.

The code is as-is (write once read never) and don't expect everything to work out of the box. If you're dealing with this, you probably know your SCAD so you'll figure it out.

If something is based on someone else's (open sourced) code, I'll do my best to make note of it in the source or the READMEs.
